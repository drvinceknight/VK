{% block intro %}
<p>These are my research pages with information about my interests, papers and grants.</p>

{% block main %}

<p>
My interests mainly lie in these three fields:
<ul>
    <li>Game Theory</li>
    <li>Queueing Theory</li>
    <li>Healthcare Modelling</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
My research is in the understanding and design of queueing systems, where individual behaviour is a factor.
</p>

<p>I have worked closely with healthcare personnel and translated theory in to practice though modeling of different aspects of the healthcare system, such as emergency units, ambulance service and social care.</p>

<h3>Research students</h3>
<p>Working with research students is one of the most rewarding parts of my job. I'm always looking for to work with enthusiastic hard working students from 1st year undergraduate to PhD level. Please get in touch if this is something you might be interested in.</p>
